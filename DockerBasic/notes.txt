#### Who serve the static file ####

1. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/

During development, if you use django.contrib.staticfiles, this will be done automatically by runserver when DEBUG is set to True (see django.contrib.staticfiles.views.serve()).


2. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/#serving-static-files-during-development

If you use django.contrib.staticfiles as explained above, runserver will do this automatically when DEBUG is set to True. If you don’t have django.contrib.staticfiles in INSTALLED_APPS, you can still manually serve static files using the django.contrib.staticfiles.views.serve() view.

Note

This helper function works only in debug mode and only if the given prefix is local (e.g. /static/) and not a URL (e.g. http://static.example.com/).

Also this helper function only serves the actual STATIC_ROOT folder; it doesn’t perform static files discovery like django.contrib.staticfiles.

You should either:
    use runserver with DEBUG=True, in that case django will serve static files by default, in doubt use staticfiles_urlpatterns or
    use a real httpd to serve STATIC_ROOT on STATIC_URL, in that case you should generate STATIC_ROOT from STATICFILES_DIRS (and actually each app's 'static' subdir, which is the point) with the command collectstatic

It's a big ISSUE to set DEBUG or not. The config is different on dev and production env

How to set uwsgi to serve static file : --static-map /static=/code/staticfiles
Let uwsgi serve the static file, or Let web server (ngnix/apache) do that

DEBUG is False, 'python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8889 --insecure' can also serve static file
